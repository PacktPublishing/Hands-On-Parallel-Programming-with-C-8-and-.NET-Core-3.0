# Hands-On Parallel Programming with C# 8 and .NET Core 3.0	[Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Parallel Programming with C# 8 and .NET Core 3.0 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/programming/hands-on-parallel-programming-with-c-8-and-net-core-3-0-video). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
With the new industry standard of increasing the processing power of machines, the concept of parallel programming was introduced as well. Concurrency has always been considered a difficult task and not many developers are confident at writing concurrent code. This course will put an end to the myth and help you become a pro at writing thread-safe code.
This course—fully comprising the latest C#8 and .NET Core 3.0 updates—will introduce you to the concepts of parallel programming in .NET Core and teach you how to take advantage of the hardware. You’ll implement TPL and PLINQ to take the best advantage of a processor and boost the speed and performance of your .NET Core applications. You’ll also apply parallel programming to your data structures.
By the end of this course, you’ll be able to parallelize your code to increase its efficiency and distribute work across multiple processors.
